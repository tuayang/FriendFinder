# FriendFinder

The Friend Finder application works much like a dating app. This version of the app adds a slight change and instead you will be matched with another Superhero (user) that is most likely to be your buddy. This full-stack site will take in results from user input, then compare the answers with those from other Superheros. The app will then display the name and picture of the Superhero with the best overall match.

### Instructions

Answer the 10 question survey. Each answer is weighed on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

The API will determine the user's most compatible friend using the totaled number of points calculated. 

Once the current user's most compatible friend is found, it will display the result with a photo and name of the Superhero.
